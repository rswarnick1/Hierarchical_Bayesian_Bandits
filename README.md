# Hierarchical_Bayesian_Bandits
Hierarchical Bayesian Bandits Playground

This repo is a playground repo to play around with the Hierarchical Bayesian Bandits model outlined here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06929

I'm experimenting with the model to get familiar with how Bayesian bandits work and to see if there are any opportunities to do some personal extensions to the model.
